# Natural Disaster

Project investigating the effects of natural disasters on human mobility. Primary goals were to 1.) Use clustering to detect when a natural disaster is occurring, and 2.) Extract changes in mobility patterns resulting from the natural disaster. The data is available here: https://www.kaggle.com/dryad/human-mobility-during-natural-disasters. For the time being, only two natural disaster events (Napa 2014 earthquake and Australia 2013 fire) were evaluated.
